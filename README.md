# Ryggrad

A CoffeeScript MVC framework with a focus on simplicity and intelligent views. Started out as a series of modifications
and extensions I was continually making to [Spine.js](http://spinejs.com/). I got tired of copying and pasting snippets
for every project, so I decided to fork. Ryggrad is to spine.js what spine.js was to Backbone.js, it is the next-
evolution of minimalist frameworks. It is built for a new era when html/js doesn't just mean web it means desktop and mobile.

*Docs and examples coming soon*

## Credits

The framework is based on [Spine.js](https://github.com/spine/spine) and code pulled from the custom MVC framework in
[Monocle](https://github.com/maccman/monocle); both projects by [Alex MacCaw](https://github.com/maccman)

The code for views based very heavily on [space-pen](https://github.com/atom/space-pen)
Attribute tracking based on code from [Spine-Attribute-Events](https://github.com/mitchlloyd/Spine-Attribute-Events)
